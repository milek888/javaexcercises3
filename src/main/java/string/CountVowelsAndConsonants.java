/*
 * Anghel Leonard -> Java Coding Problems Problem 5
 * Input is String
 * Output is Pair<Integer, Integer> result. The first element of pair includes
 * the number of vovels, the second one the number of consonants.
 * Procedure is case insensitive which means that if we have: Aa means 2 vovels
 * If String contains a given letter n-times we count it n-times: Alaaaca -> we have 5xa and count it as 5 vovels
 * Example: Input: "Ala ma kota"
 *          Output:  Vowels 5, Consonants 4
